## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model using **Lasso Regression** to predict **California house prices** based on features like location, income, and housing attributes.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ **Dataset**: Used the **California Housing Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.
- 📊 **EDA**: Performed exploratory data analysis to understand feature relationships.
- 🧹 **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized the dataset for optimal performance.
- 🔁 **Modeling**: Applied **Lasso Regression** for regularization and feature selection.
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Measured accuracy using **R² Score** and visualized results.

---

## 💡 Why Lasso Regression?

> Lasso Regression helps prevent overfitting by **shrinking less important coefficients** to zero, effectively selecting only the most relevant features — leading to a simpler and more generalizable model.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized correlations between features and target variable.
- Used `seaborn`, `matplotlib` for plotting histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
